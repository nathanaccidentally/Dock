# Dock
Dock is a tweak that brings the iOS 11 iPad dock to older devices. This includes the floating rounded dock, as well as the floating pop-up dock above apps.

The floating dock is another SBDockView, so it should be compatible with other dock tweaks.

**This branch is for experimental versions of Dock, if you wanna compile the main version, compile from the Master branch.**

**This branch includes:**
* Basic support for SpringBoard icons.
* Now the dock floats after the re-write.
* Should add support for hiding the dock on the SpringBoard.
* Now the floating dock will inhereit all values from the original dock.

If you wanna fork Dock, please fork this branch. ðŸŒ³
